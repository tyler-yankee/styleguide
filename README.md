Drake Style Guide
=================

![](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/styleguide/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=gh-pages)

This repository is a fork of Google's style guide.  Drake's C++ style is a
small deviation from Google's, and approximately tracks Google's latest style
guidance at a small delay.

The README for Google's style guide follows after some Drake-specific notes
below.

Maintenance Philosophy
----------------------

This style guide should be updated in two cases:

 * The agreement of the Drake platform reviewers on a change to our style
   rules.

 * A change from the upstream Google style guide which has been reviewed (and
   altered if necessary) by the Drake platform reviewers.

Both sorts of updates should use ordinary Reviewable review for the platform
reviewer discussion.

When making a change, annotate an html tag surrounding the new material with
`class="drake"`.  This makes it easy for readers to see Drake-relevant
changes and for maintainers to understand our diffs.  Annotate Google material
that is superseded by Drake changes but is still useful for reference with
`class="nondrake"`.

When making a change, avoid changing whitespace or indentation unnecessarily.
Conflict resolution is difficult in prose text, and conflicts that are just
paragraph reflows make future maintainers cry.

Relevant Pages
--------------

The subset of the style guides used by Drake are:

* C++ Style Guide (aka cppguide)
* Python Style Guide (aka pyguide)

Making New Changes
------------------

Branch, edit, and PR to `styleguide` as you would any other Drake change.

Pull requests merged to the `main` branch here will not be reflected on
the https://drake.mit.edu/styleguide website until you also PR to Drake
to update the git sha it uses for `styleguide`.

See [Updating Drake](#updating-drake) for more information.

Previewing Changes
------------------

See https://drake.mit.edu/documentation_instructions.html for how to preview
your changes.

Pulling Upstream Changes
------------------------

A Drake style guide maintainer should keep a local clone of this repository.
This should be set up in the usual manner, but with remotes to both Google and
Drake as you will want to (a) merge from Google and (b) rebase onto Drake
updates:

 * Fork "styleguide" into your account, this is where all your branches will be

   * Go to https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/styleguide and press "Fork" in
     the top-right corner.  If prompted for the account to fork to, select
     your account.

 * Check out your own fork

   * Go to forked repository https://github.com/**USERNAME**/styleguide and
     press the green "Clone or download" button, then select "ssh" and copy
     ssh URL

   * Clone it on your local machine:

            git clone URL_YOU_JUST_COPIED
            cd styleguide

 * Add a "drake" remote for the Drake styleguide and make it the default
   upstream.

        git remote add drake https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/styleguide.git
        git remote set-url --push drake no_push
        git fetch drake
        git branch --set-upstream-to drake/main

 * Add a "google" remote for the Drake styleguide:

        git remote add google https://github.com/google/styleguide.git
        git remote set-url --push google no_push

Now that you have a repository and remotes set up, you want to be up-to-date
with Drake and then pull Google's changes:

    git checkout main
    git pull --ff-only
    git checkout -b **NEW_BRANCH_NAME**
    git pull google gh-pages
    **RESOLVE CONFLICTS AND COMMIT**
    git push --set-upstream origin **NEW_BRANCH_NAME**
    **ORDINARY PR PROCESS**

There is a high likelihood that this merge will have conflicts.  These
conflicts represent google changes to or near Drake-specific style rules and
should be considered carefully rather than accepted or rejected blindly.

When you have resolved the merge you should commit, push, and PR in the usual
manner.  In creating the PR, double-check that you are PR'ing against
`RobotLocomotion/styleguide`, not `google/styleguide`.

You should add [all of the platform reviewers](http://drake.mit.edu/developers.html#review-process) to the resulting PR.

Ensure that Drake is updated. See [Updating Drake](#updating-drake) for more
information.

Updating Drake
--------------

Whenever a change to `styleguide` is made, be sure to submit a PR to `drake` to
bump the `styleguide` git sha.

If there are no changes `cpplint`:

1. Submit `styleguide` PR, and follow normal review process, finally merging
into the `main` branch of this repository.
2. Submit `drake` PR to bump the `styleguide` git sha, and follow the normal
review process.

If there **are** changes to `cpplint`:

1. Submit the `styleguide` PR.
2. Submit the `drake` PR, reference the `styleguide` PR, and mark as
`do not merge`.
3. Wait until `drake` `*-release` tests pass.
4. Assign review for `styleguide` PR. Merge once review is done.
5. Update the `drake` PR to use the `styleguide` merge commit (from
the `main` branch; not the PR's git sha). Follow normal review process.

Google Style Guides
===================

Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions
(sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much
easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent
style.

“Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to
“never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.” This project
([google/styleguide](https://github.com/google/styleguide)) links to the style
guidelines we use for Google code. If you are modifying a project that
originated at Google, you may be pointed to this page to see the style guides
that apply to that project.


*   [AngularJS Style Guide][angular]
*   [Common Lisp Style Guide][cl]
*   [C++ Style Guide][cpp]
*   [C# Style Guide][csharp]
*   [Go Style Guide][go]
*   [HTML/CSS Style Guide][htmlcss]
*   [JavaScript Style Guide][js]
*   [Java Style Guide][java]
*   [JSON Style Guide][json]
*   [Markdown Style Guide][markdown]
*   [Objective-C Style Guide][objc]
*   [Python Style Guide][py]
*   [R Style Guide][r]
*   [Shell Style Guide][sh]
*   [Swift Style Guide][swift]
*   [TypeScript Style Guide][ts]
*   [Vim script Style Guide][vim]

This project also contains [google-c-style.el][emacs], an Emacs settings file
for Google style.

We used to host the cpplint tool, but we stopped making internal updates public.
An open source community has forked the project, so users are encouraged to use
https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint instead.

If your project requires that you create a new XML document format, the
[XML Document Format Style Guide][xml] may be helpful. In addition to actual
style rules, it also contains advice on designing your own vs. adapting an
existing format, on XML instance document formatting, and on elements vs.
attributes.

The style guides in this project are licensed under the CC-By 3.0 License, which
encourages you to share these documents. See
[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/][ccl] for more details.

The following Google style guide lives outside of this project:

*  [Effective Dart][dart]
*  [Kotlin Style Guide][kotlin]

Since projects are largely maintained in a [VCS], writing good commit messages
is important to long term project health. Please refer to [How to Write a Git
Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) as an excellent resource. While it
explicitly refers to the Git [SCM], its principles apply to any system, and many
Git conventions are trivial to translate to others.

## Contributing

With few exceptions, these style guides are copies of Google's internal style
guides to assist developers working on Google owned and originated open source
projects. Changes to the style guides are made to the internal style guides
first and eventually copied into the versions found here. **External
contributions are not accepted.** Pull requests are regularly closed without
comment.

People can file [issues using the GitHub tracker][gh-tracker]. Issues that raise
questions, justify changes on technical merits, or point out obvious mistakes
may get some engagement and could in theory lead to changes, but we are
primarily optimizing for Google's internal needs.
